This files describes API changes for quiz report plugins.

Overview of this plugin type at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Quiz_reports


=== earlier versions ===

* ... API changes were not documented properly. Sorry. (There weren't many!)


=== 2.2 ===

* Plugins should be converted to implement cron in the standard way. In lib.php,
define a
function quiz_myreportname_cron() {};
This replaces the old way of having a separate cron.php file. Also, the cron
frequency should be defined in version.php, not in the quiz_reports table.


=== 2.3 ===

* Support for the old way of doing cron in a separate cron.php file has been removed.
You need a lib.php file inside the pluginneme (quiz report name) and a cron function
with the name quiz_pluginname_cron(), where pluginnme is the report name (e.g.:
quiz_statistics_cron()).

* Some globally defined constants with the prefix "QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_" are put inside
the abstract class "quiz_attempts_report" in Moodle 2.3.and they associate as follows:

withis the classes drived from "quiz_attempts_report":

parent::ALL_WITH            replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL
parent::ENROLLED_ALL        replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL_STUDENTS
parent::ENROLLED_WITH       replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH
parent::ENROLLED_WITHOUT    replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH_NO

quiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_ALL        replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_ALL_STUDENTS
quiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITH       replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH
quiz_attempts_report::ENROLLED_WITHOUT    replaces    QUIZ_REPORT_ATTEMPTS_STUDENTS_WITH_NO
