# moodle-mod_activitytypeheader
Moodle module allowing for activitytypeheaders to be added as text in sections. This module makes it easy to categorize activities. You might ask why create such a module since the label module is so similar. The label module allows for html in the name. This does not. This allows for greater consistency when styling the header using CSS.
