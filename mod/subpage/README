Subpage
=======

Copyright 2012 The Open University


Thes subpage module allows users to create, manage, and view lists of Moodle
activities separately from the main course page

Limitations:

The subpage module does not require any core changes. However, if you use it
without making core changes you will find that you are constantly redirected
back to the course page when you expected to be on the subpage.

If you would like a patch that you can apply - at your own risk, of course,
as is this whole thing - in order to make it all work a little more neatly, I
have included this as corechanges.patch. This applies on MOODLE_21_STABLE as
of writing. (If you do not know how to apply patches then this is not the time
to learn...) It would be nice if we could get this functionality included into
core at some point.

Also please note that if you put something on a subpage it will seem natural
for the subpage to be included in the breadcrumbs, but it is not. We have
implemented code to address this as part of our theme; doing this properly
would require a significant core change which we haven't implemented yet.
