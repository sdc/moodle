# Moodle theme 'SDC 2013'

A theme for Moodle 2.5 for [South Devon College](moodle.southdevon.ac.uk), hacked together by Paul Vaughan ([@sdcmoodle](http://twitter.com/sdcmoodle)).

## Features

* Mostly, it's the function-over-form 'Standard' theme, made prettier.
* Created using CSS3 selectors within the CSS3 sheet, so only fed to capable browsers (other browsers get the Standard theme):
  * Even more rounded corners
  * Gradient fills (purple obviously)
* Rotating Moodle logos on the front page, no matter the web browser used.

## To do

* Add profile pictures when a user is logged in. Will require further development of files in layout/.
* May rotate logos every month/hour instead of randomly, might help with theme caching.
* Social media logos, such as in the [Essential](https://github.com/moodleman/moodle-theme_essential) theme.
