<h3>"Custom corners", the Moodle theme with graphics for transparent custom corners and borders.</h3>

<p>Custom corners use the technique from Roger Johansson. He describes how to build the graphices on his page "<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200506/customising_custom_corners_and_borders/">customising_custom_corners_and_borders</a>"</p>

<p>The Moodle implementation does not use JavaScript as described in Roger Johansson's documentation. Moodle adds all neccessary divs to the pages when the option "$THEME->customcorners = true;" is set in config.php.</p>

<h4>
    Some basic information:
</h4>

<p>
    Custom_corners uses the Chameleon engine. 
    You must <strong>not</strong> write hooks as comma separated lists of elements like 
<pre>
td#middle-column div.bt, 
div#middle-column div.bt {
    ...
}
</pre>
    in Chameleon enhanced themes because the Chameleon engine can't handle these comma lists. 
    Please write two seperate statements instead.
<pre>
td#middle-column div.bt {
    ...
}
div#middle-column div.bt {
    ...
}
</pre>
