<div class="theme_description"><h2>About</h2><p>archaius is a fluid-width, three-column Moodle 2.x theme with rounded corners and tabs.
It is extremely flexible and very useful for people with some knowledge of web design and web development.</p>
<p>I propose other solution for docking of blocks.</p>                         
<p>The archaius settings page has multiple options that allow you to customize your site.</p>                                                                                         
<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>If you want to modify this theme, I recommend that you first duplicate it,                                                                                         
then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess.                                                                                                                                                                       
More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p>                                                               
<h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on anomaly themes, it was                                                                                                                     
originally designed for Moodle 1.9 by Patrick Malley. Archaius was created by Daniel Munera Sanchez using the open source libraries: jQuery, jQuerytools, PIE.js and responsiveslides.
