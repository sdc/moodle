BCU Course Checks Block
============================
This block carries out a number of automated checks on a course, that are all user configurable. The checks were designed to encourage a minimum standard of course quality, instead of forcing users and restricting their abilities.

The block also has the option to allow users to "clear down" a course, simply removing any sections that don't have content. It won't delete any sections that have content and/or a summary.

The checks that can be carried out by this block are:

* Has the course got a summary, and image set?
* Is the course visible to students?
* Has guest access been disabled on the course (helps prevent issues with automatically enrolled students)
* Have the sections been renamed from their default heading?
* Have all of the sections got a summary?
* Have all sections got content
* What blocks should each course have added to them?
