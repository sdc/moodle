This is the Mass Actions block for Moodle 3.4.

Created at University of Minnesota by the Custom Solutions team.

To install using git, type this command in the root of your Moodle install
    git clone git@github.com:at-tools/moodle-block_massaction.git

Alternatively, download the zip from
    https://github.com/at-tools/moodle-block_massaction/archive/moodle-34-master.zip
Unzip it into the blocks folder, and then rename the new folder to massaction.

Once installed, capability "block/massaction:use" needs to be added to the roles/users
(e.g. teacher) in order for them to be able to use the block.


RELEASE NOTE
[2018042400]
- Added !important rule to list-style-type for block elements; Thanks to Github
    user adpe for this! (Forgot to carry this forward to the version for 3.4)

[2017122700]
- Removed deprecated function for icons and changed html structure; Thanks to
    Github user adpe for this!
- Organized changed code into several new functions to enhance readability &
    maintainability, as well as to keep code complexity and function lengths
    to a minimum
- Updated styles.css to correctly address the unordered lists and remove list
    style types

[2017111700]
- Fixed errror in javascript so the error message will actually display when
    no checkboxes are checked

[2017092900]
- Refactored the javascript to remove all but two lint warnings
- Updated documentation in the php files to remove code pre-check warnings

[2017092801]
- Correct function call when drawing checkboxes from append() to appendChild(),
    which the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox are fault-tolerant of, whereas
    older versions of Firefox (possibly Chrome, too; unknown) were not and would
    throw a javascript error when encountered

[2017092800]
- Remove the javascript-enabled check and configuration page completely

[2017092600]
- Re-implement the deletion confirmation page that displays after the user responds
    in the affirmative to the javascript confirmation dialog box
- Moved the table heading text into language strings
- Added a configuration page and setting for controlling whether to have the block check
    whether javascript is enabled in the user's browser
- All new French language strings courtesy Google Translate
    - Better translations are welcome
- Hebrew translations have not been done; Any translations are welcome

[2017092000]
- Fixed typo in the required Moodle version (an errant '1')
- Fixed typo in the javascript causing checkboxes not to draw (a missing hyphen)

[2017091800]
*** Behavioural changes ***
- Removed the deletion confirmation page. When deleting one or more modules using
    Mass Actions, there is now only a Javascript confirmation. The confirmation page
    felt redundant and so I removed it.
- When making a selection from the "Select all in section" menu, the "Deselect all"
    action is invoked first. In the event of a misclick, this eliminates the need to
    click "Deselect all" or to manually uncheck any checked modules before making
    the correct selection from the menu. However, it means that users can no longer
    select all in two or more sections using the menu, which was probably a fairly
    rare case.
- Users of the OneTopic format may now use "Select all" to apply an action to all
    modules in their course.
- Users of the OneTopic format may now use "Select all in section" to select any
    section in their course that has modules. Previously, they were able to only
    select the section displayed on their screen. This makes the OneTopic course
    format behave like all other course formats.

*** Technical changes ***
- Converted from YUI to jQuery/AMD library
- Added ./amd/src/block_massaction.js
- Removed ./module.js and ./js/module_selector.js
- applicable_formats() now uses course_format_uses_sections() to determine whether
    to make Mass Actions available to a course format
- get_content() now provides a two dimensional array of course data to the Javascript,
    reducing the block's dependence on the DOM (and reducing its fragility)
- Added several hidden inputs to the form submitted when the user chooses the action
    to take on selected modules
- Added the _self_test function
- Changed 'moveleft' to 'outdent', 'moveright' to 'indent', 'moveto' to 'move', and
    'dupto' to 'clone'
- Renamed the 'perform_moveto' function as 'move_module' and the 'perform_dupto' function
    as 'clone_module'
- Removed the print_deletion_confirmation function
- Removed code from the perform_deletion function that has long been obsolete, as it was
    specific to Moodle 2.4 and earlier
- Moved code duplicated in move_module(), clone_module(), and perform_deletion() to new functions
    and replaced that code with function calls
- Moved capability checks that previously happened prior to calling the functions to change
    indentation or visibility to happen inside the functions, instead. This makes the timing
    and location of the capability checks for these actions consistent with the timing and
    location of the capability checks for the other actions.
- Cleaned up the naming scheme for CSS class names and ids, with the overall goal being
    to simplify them and make them more logical and predictable
- Updated styles.css as necessary
- Updated some language string keys to match the changes in naming conventions; this work
    will probably be on-going
- Removed some language strings that were clearly obsolete and no longer used

[2016111501]
- Fix bug with OneTopic format compatibility where, if the topics were not named

  because it would not draw checkboxes next to modules and would not correctly
  populate all of its drop menus

[2016111500]

  that use non-h3 tags for section headings, from Dan Davis (rndme)
