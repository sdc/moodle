<p align="center"><b>Hint button </b></p>

<p>Selecting <strong>Display Hint Button</strong> -&gt; <strong>Yes</strong> will display a <strong>Hint</strong> button in order to allow the student to ask for a letter. This letter will be added to the student's actual response, possibly after extraneous wrong letters have been removed. If the penalty scheme has been enabled in the Quiz settings this hint will cost the student one penalty factor. When the student takes the quiz, moving the cursor over the Hint button will display a tooltip saying how much it will cost to &quot;buy&quot; a letter. By default Display Hint button value is set at No. Questions created prior to Feb. 2007 will have this value set at No. If you want to display the Hint button you'll have to edit those questions and select Yes and save. Please note that the Hint button will only be available to quizzes which have their Adaptive mode set to Yes, as it does not make sense to enable the Hint button for non-adaptive tests. </p>
