	* filter/activitynames/filter.php, mod/glossary/filter.php,
	mod/resource/filter.php, mod/wiki/filter.php: 
	
	Auto-linking filters: fix serious caching bug in forum mailouts
	
	Autolinking of glossaries, activity, resources and wiki names were
	using a trivial single-entry cache implemented with static vars.
	The cache was _not_ keyed on course.
	
	This bug was visible during forum_cron() which walks many courses.
	The cache would get "stuck" on the first course that had something
	to put in the cache.  All mailouts from there onwards would
	autolink to stuff in the wrong course.
