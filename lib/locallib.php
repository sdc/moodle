/**
 * This file provides hooks from moodle core into custom code.
 * 
 * Important note
 * --------------
 * 
 * If at all possible, the facilities provided here should not be used. 
 * Wherever possible, customisations should be written using one of the 
 * standard plug-in points like modules, blocks, auth plugins, themes, ...
 * 
 * However, sometimes that is just not possible, because of the nature
 * of the change you want to make. In which case the second best plan is
 * to implement your feature in a generally useful way, which can
 * be contributed back to the moodle project so that everyone benefits.
 * 
 * But supposing you are forced to implement some nasty hack that only
 * you will ever want, then the local folder is for you. The idea is that
 * instead of scattering your changes throughout the code base, you 
 * put them all in a folder called 'local'. Then you won't have to
 * deal with merging problems when you upgrade the rest of your moodle
 * installation.
 * 
 * 
 * Available hooks
 * ===============
 * 
 * These are similar to the module interface, however, not all the the
 * facilities that are available to modules are available to local code (yet).
 * 
 * 
 * Local database customisations
 * -----------------------------
 * 
 * If your local customisations require changes to the database, use the files:
 * 
 * local/version.php
 * local/db/upgrade.php
 * 
 * In the file version.php, set the variable $local_version to a versionstamp
 * value like 2006030300 (a concatenation of year, month, day, serial).
 * 
 * In the file upgrade.php, implement the
 * function xmldb_local_upgrade($oldversion) to make the database changes.
 * 
 * Note that you don't need to have an install.xml file. Instead,
 * when your moodle instance is first installed, xmldb_local_upgrade() will be called
 * with $oldversion set to 0, so that all the updates run.
 * 
 * 
 * Course deletion
 * ---------------
 * 
 * To have your local customisations notified when a course is deleted,
 * make a file called 
 * 
 * local/lib.php
 * 
 * In there, implement the function local_delete_course($courseid). This
 * function will then be called whenever the functions remove_course_contents()
 * or delete_course() from moodlelib are called.
 */

/**
 * This function checks to see whether local database customisations are up-to-date
 * by comparing $CFG->local_version to the variable $local_version defined in 
 * local/version.php. If not, it looks for a function called 'xmldb_local_upgrade'
 * in a file called 'local/db/upgrade.php', and if it's there calls it with the 
 * appropiate $oldversion parameter. Then it updates $CFG->local_version.
 * On success it prints a continue link. On failure it prints an error.
 * 
 * @uses $CFG 
 * @uses $db to do something really evil with the debug setting that should probably be eliminated. TODO!
 * @param string $continueto a URL passed to print_continue() if the local upgrades succeed.
