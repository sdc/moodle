<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Importing new questions</B></P>

<P>This function allows you to import questions from 
   external text files.  

<P>Several common file formats are supported:

<P><B>Missing word format</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This format only supports multiple choice questions.
Each answer is separated with a tilde (~), and the correct answer is 
prefixed with an equals sign (=).  Here is an example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology 
~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you have your own format that you need to import, you can 
   implement it yourself by editing mod/quiz/format/custom.php

<P>The amount of new code needed is quite small - just enough
   to parse a single question from given text.
