<h1>Embedding media in a frame</h1>
<p>The normal way to display embedded media is either in an object element, if your
browser supports it, or on a page of its own. These methods are compliant with 
XHTML strict standards. However, in some cases, your browser may not support the
type of file you want to embed, and you still want it to appear within your site's context 
(with the navigation breadcrumbs etc..). The only way to do this is to enable this option.
However, this is not compliant with XHTML strict.</p>
<p>
If your users have the option screenreader switched on in their profile, it will override this
option, so that frames will never be used to display embedded media for these users.
