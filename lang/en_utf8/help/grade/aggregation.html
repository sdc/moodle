<h1>Category aggregation</h1>
<p>This menu lets you choose the aggregation strategy that will be used to calculate
each participant's overall grade for this category. The different options are explained below.</p>

<p>The grades are first converted to percentage values (interval from 0 to 1), then aggregated using one of
the function bellow and finally converted to requested range of associated category item (<em>Minimum grade</em> and <em>Maximum grade</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: An empty grade is simply a missing gradebook entry, and could
mean different things. For example, it could be a participant who hasn't yet submitted an assignment,
an assignment submission not yet graded by the teacher, or a grade that has been manually deleted by
the gradebook administrator. Caution in interpreting these "empty grades" is thus advised.</p>
