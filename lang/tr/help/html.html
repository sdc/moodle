<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Help on writing html</B></P>

<P>When writing HTML in Moodle, you are free to use any HTML tags you like
   to produce the effect you want.

<P>Your code will normally be printed on the page within a table cell, 
   so:

   <UL>
   <LI>there is no need to use any &lt;HEAD> or &lt;BODY> tags
   <LI>be careful about unmatched &lt;/TABLE> tags that may mess up the display.
   </UL>
