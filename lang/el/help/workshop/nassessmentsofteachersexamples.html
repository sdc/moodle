<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Number of Assessments of Teacher's Examples</B></P>

<P>This number determines whether the students are asked to assess
	any example peices of work before submitting their own work. If it is
	not zero then each student must assess that number of example pieces 
	of work to a satisfactory level. This means that the teacher must grade 
	these assessments before the student can submit work. The student is
	shown the teacher's comments  and grade for each of their 
	assessments.
