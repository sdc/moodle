<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading the Student Assessments</B></P>

<P>This screen is used to enter the teacher's grade for the assessment made
	by the student during the submission and assessment phase of the assignment. A relatively
	simple grading is used, the score out of 20. The treacher can decide what is
	being graded and the relative scores from the instructions given to the students
	before the assignment started. For example, at a higher level the students may be
	required to give critical comments, at an intermediate level the students may be
	required to point out strengths and weaknesses, and at a lower level the students 
	may be simply pointing out errors and inaccuracies.
	
<P>If available the Teacher's own assessment is shown before that of the
	student so an easy comparison can be made. The teacher's own 
	comments can act as a kind of benchmark.

<P>The grades of assessment is
	saved by clicking on the apprpriate button at the foot of the page. There is a
	chance to repeat the grading within the &quot;editing&quot; period. Once that
	time has elapsed the grade is made available to the student.
