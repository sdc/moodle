<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Managing a Workshop Assignment</B></P>

<P>A Workshop Assignment is more complex than an ordinary assignment.
	It involves a number of steps or phases. These are
<OL>
<LI>The assessment of the assignment should be broken into a number
	of assessment ELEMENTS. This makes the grading of an assignment less
	arbitary and gives the students a framework on which to make assessments. 
	The teacher has the role of setting up the assessment elements thus making a
	grading sheet. (See that page for more details.)
	
	<P>With the assessment elements set up the teacher will normally submit a 
	small number of example pieces of work. These are practice pieces for the 
	students to assess before preparing their own pieces of work. However, 
	before the assignment is made available to students, these example 
	pieces should be assessed by the teacher. This provides the students 
	with not only examples for the assignment but also specimen assessments 
	on those examples.
	<P>The submission of example pieces of work by the teacher is optional 
	and for certain assignments may not be appropriate.
	
<LI>The assignment is now opened to the students. If the teacher has set up
	example pieces of work the students can be asked to assess a number of these.
	In this case, the teacher must grade these assessments and the students must
	reach a satisfactory standard before they are allowed submit their own work.
	Here, a &quot;satisfactory standard&quot; has been set at 40%. Once a student
	has &quot;passed&quot; the required number of assessments they are free to
	submit their own work.
	<P>When a student submits a piece of work the teacher can, if desired assess that
	work. This assessment can be incorporated into the student final grade. These
	assessments, if they are required, can take place either during the submission
	phase of the assignment or after the submission deadline.	
	<P>If the assignment incorporates peer assessment, students who have submitted
	work are shown other students' work to assess. When they have made an assessment
	their peer can see that assessment (but the other student cannot comment on it.) 
	The teacher, however, can, if desired, grade the assessment and that score is taken 
	forward towards the student's final grade.

<LI>After the deadline has passed, the teacher moves the assignment to the next phase
	where further submissions and assessments by students are not allowed. The teacher 
	can, if wished,  grade the peer assessments made by the students. This is not really
	necessary as provided a reason number of assessments have been made on each
	submission the &quot;grading performance&quot; of each student can be 
	determined from the relative scores. The teacher now calculates the final grades 
	of the students.	These final grades are normally made up of three components, 
	teacher's grade of the student's work, mean peer grade of the student's work
	and the student's grading performance. The last can include the mean &quot;grading 
	grade&quot; entered by the teacher against a student's comments. These three 
	components are given weights by the teacher before the calculation of the final 
	grades takes place.

<LI>The final phase of the assignment is entered to allow the students to see their
	final grades. The teacher can, be desired, backtrack the assignment to allow some 
	adjustment of, say, the weights used in the final grade calculation, the revised 
	grades can then be shown to the students.
