<p align="center"><b>Analysis Options</b></p>

<p>The range of quiz attempts that are procesed and analyzed can be selected. 
There are two parameters to specify which attempts are used: </p>

<p><b>Attempt selection:</b></p> 
It may be convenient to analyze just one quiz attempt for each user. 
This particular attempt may be the one with the highest overall score, 
the first attempt or the last attempt of those performed. Or all attempts data may 
be collected for a cummulative analysis.</p>

<p><b>Rejection of low scores:</b></p> 
<p>Sometimes the users are just browsing the quiz, exploring it, 
and not going through it for a grade. It is common that such 'trial' attempts 
get very low scores. These byassing data can be excluden from analysis by 
setting a low limit for the score of the attempts to analyze. This limit is 
specified as a percentage (0-100) of the maximum grade achievable in the quiz.</p>
