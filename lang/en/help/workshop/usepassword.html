<p align="center"><b>Use Password</b></p>

<p>Normally a workshop is open, that is if a workshop is visible, students can
    see the contents of the workshop. The availability of an 
    workshop within the course is normally best controlled through the 
    Visible/Hide activity feature.</p>

    <p>The Use Password option is used to associate an 
    &quot;access&quot; password with the workshop. There may be 
    occasions when it is necessary to password protect a workshop. For 
    example, a workshop may be used with several groups of students in a 
    course and each group is set the workshop at different times. The access 
    password is used to prevent the &quot;second&quot; group of students, say, 
    from doing the workshop once the workshop has been opened up for the 
    &quot;first&quot; group.</p>
