<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Reading Type</B></P>

<P>Readings are any content you can dream up.  These are the 
   different types, which mostly specify how the content is 
   to be accessed:

<P><B>Plain text</B> - the easiest type.  You can just type (edit) the page into a form on the following page.

<P><B>Reference</B> - a scholarly reference to a journal or book.

<P><B>Uploaded file</B> - displays any file you have uploaded into the course.  See the 'Files' section.

<P><B>Web Link</B> - A URL to somewhere on the web.  When anyone clicks on this reading 
activity they will be taken out of the course (the page you've specified will fill the browser window).

<P><B>Web page</B> - A URL to somewhere on the web.  Like the previous type, this 
will display a web page.  Unlike the previous type, though, the page will displayed 
within a frame, as if it is integrated within the course.
